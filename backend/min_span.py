    Python implementation of minimum spanning tree

    Any points already connected together by edges
    are considered to be in the same "forest". At
    the start, since no points have been connected
    yet, each point is in its own "forest".

    The algorithm finds the two closest points in
    different "forests", connects them with an
    edge, and combines them into one forest. This
    is repeated until there is only one forest.

    This is a greedy algorithm. Because it always
    searches for the shortest useful edge, the end
    result will use the shortest edges possible.
